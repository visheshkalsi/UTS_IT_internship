Q1.
Building and micro testing stages of software release process is often referred as Continuous Integration (CI). It’s when developers from DevOps software development practice meet and regularly merge their code changes in a central repository. Each change that is occurred triggers an automated build and test on the new code to check its validity. This takes place before running of the automated tests and build stage. Whereas Continuous Delivery (CD) comes in action after the build stage. It’s when code changes take place automatically after being prepared for a release to production. It does test beyond unit tests so that developers can verify application updates across multiple dimensions before deploying to customers the final product. No deploy can take place in CI whereas a manually approved option is present in CD.

Q2.
For CI and CD the following apps are used often due to these reasons:
1. CircleCI – Can run tests in parallel, performance optimized for quick builds, analytics to measure build performance
2. Jenkins - Hosted internally, can be quickly installed, and configured, ability to distribute work across multiple machines, open source
3. Codeship - Deployment pipeline configuration, simple UI to set up workflows, native Docker support
